# Image Loading Issues - Summary of Fixes

## Issue Overview

The application was experiencing problems with loading images from Supabase storage. The key issues were:

1. **CORS Configuration**: The browser was blocking cross-origin requests to Supabase storage
2. **Image URL Structure**: Some image URLs had redundant path segments (e.g., `.../upload/uploads/...`)
3. **Image Component Issues**: The custom components were adding problematic crossOrigin attributes

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Backend Configuration Fix

The primary issue was resolved by simplifying the Helmet configuration:

```javascript
// src/app.js
app.use(helmet({
  crossOriginResourcePolicy: false
}));
```

This allows cross-origin resources (like images from Supabase) to be loaded without CORS errors.

### 2. Frontend Component Updates

- Replaced custom `ImageComponent` with direct `<img>` tags in all components:
  - Dashboard.js
  - Home.js
  - Posts.js
  - PostDetail.js
  - EditPost.js

- Added proper error handling for image loading:
  ```javascript
  <img 
    src={imageUrl}
    alt={alt}
    onError={(e) => {
      e.target.onerror = null;
      e.target.src = "https://via.placeholder.com/400x300?text=Image+Not+Available";
    }}
  />
  ```

### 3. Image URL Structure Fix

- Added scripts to fix existing database URLs that contained redundant path segments
- Modified the `uploadToSupabase` middleware to use correct path structure for future uploads

### 4. Diagnostic Tools

- Created `ImageDebugFixed` component to provide detailed diagnostic information
- Added a test upload page at `/upload-test` to verify upload functionality
- Created PowerShell script (`start-both.ps1`) to easily run both frontend and backend

## Running the Application

### Method 1: Using the PowerShell Script
```
.\start-both.ps1
```

### Method 2: Manual Start
Open two separate PowerShell windows:

1. Backend:
```
cd backend
npm run dev
```

2. Frontend:
```
cd frontend
npm start
```

## Verifying the Fix

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/upload-test
2. Upload a test image and verify it appears properly
3. Check Posts to confirm existing images now display correctly
