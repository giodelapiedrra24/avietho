# Supabase CORS Settings - Legacy vs Current Approach

## Important Update (2024-2025)

If you're looking for the CORS settings in the Supabase dashboard and can't find them, there's a reason for that - **Supabase has changed how CORS is handled**. According to recent information, Supabase no longer exposes CORS configuration directly in the dashboard UI as it did before.

## What Used to Be There (Legacy Approach)

Previously, you could find CORS settings in the Supabase dashboard:
1. Log in to your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to Settings in the left sidebar
3. Click on API in the submenu
4. Scroll down to find the CORS section
5. Add your domains to the "Allowed Origins" field

This UI-based configuration made it easy to add domains to the allowed CORS origins list.

## Current Approach (As of 2024-2025)

Supabase now handles CORS differently depending on which part of the service you're using:

### 1. REST API (PostgREST)

Supabase's REST API now automatically adds basic CORS headers by default. You don't control these directly through the dashboard, but they generally work for standard use cases.

For most applications, this automatic configuration is sufficient if:
- Your frontend domain is served over HTTPS
- You use standard headers
- You don't need special CORS configurations

### 2. Storage

For Supabase Storage, CORS is managed at the storage service level, not through a separate configuration panel. The storage service has its own CORS handling.

### 3. Edge Functions

For Edge Functions, you need to handle CORS manually in your code. This gives you more control but requires explicit coding:

```javascript
// Example CORS headers for Edge Functions
const corsHeaders = {
  'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
  'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'authorization, x-client-info, apikey, content-type',
};

// Handle OPTIONS requests for CORS preflight
if (req.method === 'OPTIONS') {
  return new Response('ok', { headers: corsHeaders });
}

// Add headers to your actual response
return new Response(JSON.stringify(data), {
  headers: { ...corsHeaders, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  status: 200,
});
```

## Solutions for Advanced CORS Needs

If you need more fine-grained control over CORS than what Supabase provides automatically:

1. **Use a Proxy Layer**: Set up a middleware or reverse proxy (like Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge Middleware, or a custom Express server) in front of Supabase.

2. **Handle CORS Manually in Edge Functions**: As shown above, you can add the appropriate headers to your responses.

3. **Create a Custom API Gateway**: Build your own API gateway that handles CORS and forwards requests to Supabase.

## Testing Your CORS Configuration

To verify if CORS is working correctly:

1. Use browser developer tools (Network tab) to check for CORS errors
2. Test a simple fetch request from your application
3. Look for the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header in the response

## Getting Support

If you're still having CORS issues after trying these approaches, you can:
1. Contact Supabase support through the dashboard
2. Ask questions in the Supabase Discord community
3. Check the Supabase GitHub repository for recent updates on CORS handling
